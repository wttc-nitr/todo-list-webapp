# a simple todo-list webapp

Take a note, edit it, delete it or mark it as completed.

This CRUD webapp uses your browser's local-storage to store notes. That means notes will be still there, even if you refresh the page.

It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://wttc-nitr.github.io/todo-list-webapp/).
